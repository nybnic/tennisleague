# Product Principles

These principles guide all product decisions.  
If a feature conflicts with these, it should be reconsidered.

---

## 1. Competitive Insight Is the Core Value

This app exists to make amateur tennis leagues feel intelligent.

Elo ratings, predictions, streaks, rivalries, and trends are the product.
Administrative tools are supporting features — not the focus.

If something does not enhance competitive understanding, it is secondary.

---

## 2. Simplicity Over Feature Creep

The app should feel lightweight and intentional.

Prefer:
- Clear flows
- Opinionated defaults
- Minimal configuration

Avoid:
- Complex admin panels
- Edge-case-driven feature bloat
- Enterprise-style settings

---

## 3. Data Should Feel Alive

Raw tables are not enough.

The system should automatically highlight:
- Upsets
- Streaks
- Improvements
- Rivalries
- Surface performance differences

Insights > spreadsheets.

---

## 4. Mobile-First Always

Primary interactions (viewing league, entering match results, checking ratings)
must feel smooth on mobile.

Desktop support is secondary.

---

## 5. Progressive Disclosure of Complexity

Advanced settings (rules, rating configuration, season structure)
should be available — but never intrusive.

Most leagues should work immediately with sensible defaults.

---

## 6. Persistent Player Identity

Players are long-term entities.

Their performance history should:
- Survive seasons
- Be comparable over time
- Extend beyond a single league

Continuity builds meaning.

---

## 7. Frictionless Participation

Joining and using a league should be effortless.

- Magic link authentication
- Invite codes
- Minimal onboarding
- No unnecessary forms

Complexity reduces adoption.

---

## 8. Opinionated by Default

The app should make strong decisions for users.

A league should function immediately after creation.
Configuration is optional, not required.

---

## 9. Avoid Bureaucracy

This is not club management software.

We do not optimize for:
- Billing
- Court booking
- Membership management
- Tournament brackets

The focus remains competitive analytics.
